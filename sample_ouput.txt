Pursuant to the requirements of Section  13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly 
caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, on February 21, 2024. In 2023, we introduced our first data 
center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. With a strong engineering culture, we drive 
fast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, 
networking, software and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.
The world’s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale 
accelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end users, 
including AI solutions and assistants, search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, and 
translation.
Enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new 
generative AI-enabled products and services, or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and 
workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI assistants and chatbots; the transportation industry 
for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug discovery; and the financial 
services industry for customer support and fraud detection.
4Researchers and developers use our computing solutions to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from 
simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 3,500 applications, NVIDIA computing 
enables some of the most promising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind 
tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers over 75% of the supercomputers on the 
global TOP500 list, including 24 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list. 
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. In addition to serving the growing 
number of gamers, the market for PC GPUs is expanding because of the burgeoning population of live streamers, 
broadcasters, artists, and creators. With the advent of generative AI, we expect a broader set of PC users to choose 
NVIDIA GPUs for running generative AI applications locally on their PC, which is critical for privacy, latency, and cost-
sensitive AI applications.
Professional artists, architects and designers use NVIDIA partner products accelerated with our GPUs and software 
platform for a range of creative and design use cases, such as creating visual effects in movies or designing buildings and 
products. In addition, generative AI is expanding the market for our workstation-class GPUs, as more enterprise 
customers develop and deploy AI applications with their data on-premises. 
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in 
Delaware in April 1998. 
Our Businesses
We report our business results in two segments.
The Compute & Networking segment is comprised of our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and end-to-end 
networking platforms including Quantum for InfiniBand and Spectrum for Ethernet; our NVIDIA DRIVE automated-driving 
platform and automotive development agreements; Jetson robotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise 
and other software; and DGX Cloud software and services.
The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and 
related infrastructure; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU, or vGPU, software for 
cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise 
software for building and operating metaverse and 3D internet applications. 
Our Markets
We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These 
platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our 
platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and 
Automotive.
Data Center
The NVIDIA Data Center platform is focused on accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads, such as AI, data 
analytics, graphics and scientific computing, delivering significantly better performance and power efficiency relative to 
conventional CPU-only approaches. It is deployed in cloud, hyperscale, on-premises and edge data centers. The platform 
consists of compute and networking offerings typically delivered to customers as systems, subsystems, or modules, 
along with software and services.  
Our compute offerings include supercomputing platforms and servers, bringing together our energy efficient GPUs, 
DPUs, interconnects, and fully optimized AI and high-performance computing, or HPC, software stacks. In addition, they 
include NVIDIA AI Enterprise software; our DGX Cloud service; and a growing body of acceleration libraries, APIs, SDKs, 
and domain-specific application frameworks.A Defining Year and the 
Start of a Defining Decade
This year was a watershed moment 
for NVIDIA, our customers, and our 
ecosystem partners. NVIDIA accelerated 
computing has reached the tipping point, 
fundamentally reinvented computing, 
and is the path forward for sustainable 
computing. Generative AI is driving a 
platform transition and starting a new 
industrial revolution where AI factories 
will manufacture intelligence. NVIDIA 
is at the center of the simultaneous 
computing and industrial revolution.
NVIDIA is the result of the decades-
long pursuit of a vision and the life’s 
work of our employees. NVIDIA is 
well-known for the caliber of our people, 
who have worked together for a long 
time, and our determined and resilient 
culture that prioritizes our people.2023 was an extraordinary year. 
Though trouble around the world 
made it challenging, I’m incredibly 
proud of the character of people, 
proud that we supported our families 
throughout, and proud that we focused 
on creating the conditions for our 
employees to do their life’s work. 
2024 is shaping up to be even more 
incredible. We can expect unbelievable 
technology breakthroughs from 
next-level LLMs and generative 
AI across many industries, from 
digital biology to robotics. You’ll 
want to see what’s coming
